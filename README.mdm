The Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation ([ITS_LIVE](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov)) is a NASA MEaSUREs project to provide automated, low latency, global glacier flow and elevation change datasets.

Welcome to the ITS_LIVE production github repository. This repository is intended for internal project use and captures tools and scripts that are used to build velocity-pair datacubes and mosaics. 
To access notebooks that show how to access and use ITS_LIVE data products please refer to the [its-live](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/its_live) repository.
